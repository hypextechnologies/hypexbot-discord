FAQ
 
Should there be more files?


We could add many more files but were not here to flood you with a lot of files and folders that are not understandable.
 
 
How to add commands?


if (command === "command") {
  	message.channel.send("message");
  }
  
  
How can i change Hypex Technologies messages?


On the console.log('') edit everything inside the apostrophes('')


What is the error (node:10304)?


Just some random error output that has no effect to the bot, best thing to do is ignore it. Yes it does spam console(If you wanna remove it goto the client.on('error', console.error) and remove it)
